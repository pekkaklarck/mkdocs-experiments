# Robot Framework API

Robot Framework's primary, stable public API is provided by the [robot.api][]
module. You may sometimes need to import items also from other modules, but
that should be relatively rare.

Command line entry points that can also be used programmatically are
implemented by the following modules:

  * [robot.run][] entry point for executing tests.
  * `robot.rebot` entry point for post-processing outputs (Rebot).
  * `robot.libdoc` entry point for the Libdoc tool.
