# Welcome

Here's a simple Robot Framework example to get us started! :rocket:

```robotframework
*** Test Case ***
Example
    Log    Hello, world!
```

And here's another example using :fontawesome-brands-python::

```python
def example():
    print('Hello, world!')
```

Here's a link to [another page](1. Input data.md). And here's another to
link directly to a [section](1. Input data.md#json-format). Below we have an image.
