# Robot Framework Manual with Material for MkDocs

Experimenting using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) 
as a documentation platform for Robot Framework Manual that is planned to
replace the current [Robot Framework User Guide](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html).

This repository is mainly a playground for testing various features. There will
be a separate repository for real content and final plan is to merge it to
Robot Framework main repository.

See the generated pages at https://pekkaklarck.github.io/mkdocs-experiments/.
