# Robot Framework User Guide with Material for MkDocs

Experimenting using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) 
as a documentation platform for Robot Framework User Guide.

See the generated pages at https://pekkaklarck.github.io/rf-uk-mkdocs/.

Based on an [introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-YA_dA8C20)
linked from Material for MkDocs pages. Initial project configuration was
copied from the [example project](https://github.com/james-willett/mkdocs-material-youtube-tutorial)
in the aforementioned tutorial video.

Actual content has been copied from a [separate project](https://github.com/alexkread/rfuserguide/)
where the [current User Guide](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html)
is converted from reStructuredText to Markdown and also enhanced otherwise. 

Installations:

    pip install "mkdocs-material[imaging]"
